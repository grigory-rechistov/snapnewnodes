Known bugs and limitations


* Sometimes the plugin chooses a wrong route on a destination way, resulting in a
  completely broken result. Always control visually that the result meets your
  expectations, and use Undo if it does not.

* It is expected that every target segment to snap to will consist of continuous
  sections of destination way. If the destination way has loops tightly placed
  to themselves resulting in more than one segment being closer than a threshold
  value to a current node, the snapping algorithm may choose to jump between them
  giving in a broken result. Typically, if it is not trivial for a human to
  figure out what an end result should look like because of the target way being
  too tightly spaced to itself, the plugin would not be able to figure it out
  either. Lowering the threshold may help if there is a clearly visible maximum
  gap between loops. If the target way self-intersects, fix it first.

* Leftover duplicate nodes and unconnected nodes without tags may be present.
  They are detected by the validator and can be automatically fixed later.
  
* AngleTreshold is not configurable through the preferences dialog.

* Deletion of zero angle at the first/last node position is not done

* Some nodes that are better left alone (e.g. with tags och connecting several 
  ways) are nevertheless moved.
