Known bugs and limitations


* Sometimes the plugin chooses wrong half of a way to snap to, resulting in
  completely broken result. Always control visually that the result meets your
  expectations, and use Undo if it does not.

* It is expected that every target segment to snap to will consist of continuous
  sections of destination way. If the destination way has loops tighly placed
  to themselves resulting in more than one segment being closer than a threshold
  value to acurrent node, the snapping algorithm may choose to jump between them
  giving in a borken result. Typically, if it is not trivial for a human to
  figure out what an end result shoud look like because of the target way being
  too tightly spaced to itself, the plugin would not be able to figure it out
  either. Lowering the threshold may help if there is a clearly visible maximum
  gap between loops. If the target way self-intersects, fix it first.
