Select exactly two ways, and the tool will glue sections of the first way to
sections of the second way when distance between them is less than specified
threshold (in meters).

Be sure to read `BUGS` as this plugin certainly has many!

Example
=========

In order to snap all nodes of the forest way that are closer than a given threshold
to the water way, choose forest and then add water to the selection (selection
order is important):
